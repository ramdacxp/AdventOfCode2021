# Advent of Code 2021

![AoC](aoc.png)

These are my program snippets to solve the daily puzzles of [Advent Of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

Each day contains a C# console app project (using [DotNet SDK 6.0](http://dot.net)), which can be executed via `dotnet run`.
The Puzzles (together with the answers!) are available in `README.txt`.
Required input data for each puzzle is available in `input.txt`.
